# Color Scrape

I was need color palette for using when i developing filter application.
I scraped from http://www.novact.info/id40.html instead of create array with hand.

## Getting Started

I developed with scrapy framework of django. If you need scrape different web site. You can edit detected html edited.
If you need other properties or guide, the best document is https://scrapy.org/ .
